## How to mute and unmute

In lower left corner of the client you an unmute yourself if you want to say
something but please keep your microphone muted in the main room:

If you are in a quiet place, staying unmuted in breakout rooms is reasonable.
We encourage discussion in breakout rooms.


## Please use your real name (instead of a system default username)

Click on "Participants" (bottom, middle):

You can rename yourself by clicking the blue "Rename" next to your name:

<img src="img/rename1.jpg" width="400"/>

<img src="img/rename2.jpg" width="800"/>


## How to signal if you are away from keyboard

Please select the "clock" symbol if you are away or otherwise busy:

<img src="img/clock.jpg" width="400"/>


## How to signal when you completed a task successfully

We will sometimes ask you to signal to us once you have successfully completed
an exercise or type-along step. You can do this using the green check symbol:

## How to signal a technical problem or that you got stuck

If you hit a technical problem or got stuck somewhere in an exercise
or type-along, please let us know with the red circle symbol:

<img src="img/problem.jpg" width="400"/>

We will then probably ask you to unmute and briefly describe the problem and then based
on the problem and timing we may assign you into a separate virtual room with a helper where
they can resolve the problem.

Once we have assigned you a helper we will ask you and the helper to "Join
Breakout Room" (bottom right):

## How to give feedback on the speed

There are also signals for faster and slower and with this you can indicate to
us whether we should adjust the speed.
